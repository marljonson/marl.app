                Born and raised in the Bay Area, I grew up on Mario, Roblox, and Alice: Madness Returns. I want to help coordinate the building of tools, aplatforms, and experiences that push the needle.

                I like to connect the dots between users, designers, engineers, and ideas. As a product design and management intern at Bay Area Rapid Transit, I'm working on a game that introduces youth to underserved transit careers.

                Born and raised in the Bay Area, I grew up on Mario, Roblox, and Alice: Madness Returns. I want to help build the tools, platforms, and experiences that push the needle.

                Currently, I'm connecting the dots between users, designers, engineers, and wild ideas. As a product design intern at the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, I'm developing a game to introduce youth to underserved transit careers.
